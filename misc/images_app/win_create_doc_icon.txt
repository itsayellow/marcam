Creating a Document Icon on Windows
===================================

Get Windows Blank Document Icon
-------------------------------

C:\WINDOWS\system32\shell32.dll,1

Use NirSoft IconsExtract to extract Windows generic document icon from
shell32.dll,1
Save this to win_generic_file.ico


Create Marcam Upper Layer Icon
------------------------------

Can just convert marcam_icon55_layer.icns to marcam_icon55_layer.ico

OR:
ico2dir win_generic_file.ico

Open win_generic_file.dir/icon_256x256.png in photoshop
on a new layer, position a 55% sized version of app.icon on top
    position icon so distance to sides is the same as distance to bottom
    of win_generic_file img
In this new icon layer, Select-All, and Copy

In new blank image with transparent bg (1024x1024)
    Paste Special->Paste in place
Export image (just the icon with placement) as its own
    png file, marcam_icon55_layer.png

gen_ico marcam_icon55_layer.png
    (to make marcam_icon55_layer.ico)

marcam_icon55_layer.ico is the marcam main application icon, resized to 55%
of its full size, and lowered.

Make sure that marcam_icon55_layer.ico has all of the same size constituent
images as win_generic_file.ico
