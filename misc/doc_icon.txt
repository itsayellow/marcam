Start with GenericDocumentIcon
Layer 3: paper curl is top layer
Layer 2: Shadows
    All Black layer
    Layer Mask with:
        create version of icon with white background in separate file
        Invert this (black<->white)
        Copy this into Layer mask (using Option-Click to select Layer mask)
        Slide Levels top slider to make more or less shadow in shadow areas
            Changing from 255 to 192 seems close to right
Layer 1: Totally white outline of icon
    Select everythin inside icon paper, excluding curled corner
        using magic wand, keep adding magic wand areas until all 
        selected in paper
    Create new layer, keeping selection, and fill with white      


Put downsized app icon in between Layer 1 and Layer 2
    50% to 55% seems about right
    Probably put as distance from icon edge to bottom paper edge
        as from icon edge to left/right edges
