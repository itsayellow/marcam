# Version 0.4: Github release

date: 2018 Jul 03
tag: v0.4
commit: 76a35f0

A "mostly good enough for public consumption" release.

This release has functional macOS and Windows builds that allow manual loading, marking, and saving of images.  The application keeps count of how many marks you make in the toolbar.

Marcam inside the dmg file should run on any Mac OS X that is Yosemite (10.10.5) or later.

Marcam.Installer.exe was created on a Windows 10 Home version 1803.
