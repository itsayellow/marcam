# Version 0.5: Copy Marks Total and Windows Bugfixes

Notable Improvements:
* Now Ctrl-C / Cmd-C or pushing the "To Clipboard" toolbar button copies the total number of marks to the clipboard.
* Changed Temporary Zoom to be activated with space bar (instead of Option / Alt key as before).  This allows it to function properly on Windows.
* Fixed dragged rubber-band box selection on Windows so it has the correct appearance
* Improved and updated help
* Fixes for Windows icon bugs: #65 and #66 
* Fixed: "Save As" now behaves properly (instead of erroneously as "Export Image").

Marcam inside the dmg file should run on any Mac OS X that is Yosemite (10.10.5) or later.

Marcam.Installer.exe was created on a Windows 10 Home version 1803.
