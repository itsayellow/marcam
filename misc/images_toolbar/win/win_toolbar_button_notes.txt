    Summary:
        *.odg (LibreOffice Draw) -> *.eps (Export) -> *32.png (vec2png 32 *.eps)

    Procedure:
        1. Create a vector-drawn version (e.g. with LibreOffice Draw, etc.)
            A. Create e.g. a 32in. x 32in sized canvas
            B. Use a grid of 1in., or corresponding to one grid per pixel
                of the final rasterized image
            C. Make sure any horizontal and vertical lines are exactly in
                the grid, i.e. they are sized and positioned correctly
                i. width of 1in. = 72pt
                ii. centers on (n+0.5)" where n is an integer
            D. Fill canvas as much as possible
            E. Use color 0,0,0 or #000000 as default
            D. Write out EPS (EPS prefereable, bugs with SVG readers)
                i. EPS: Level 2 color, no tiff preview
        2. Rasterize
            A. use imagemagick to convert to 32px x 32px image with "box"
                filter, which takes average color under pixel area:
                ../../../build_scripts/vec2png 32 *.eps
                    -or-
                convert -colorspace sRGB -background transparent input.{eps,svg}
                        -filter box -resize 32x32 PNG32:output.png
        3. Clean up resulting png if necessary
            A. For pixels partially overlapping original lines, use
                same color but variable transparency, do NOT use lighter color


Specific Bitmap Notes
---------------------
    Zoom to fit:
        On small PNG:
            Erase corner of square at tail of arrows
        
    Mark Mode:
        On small PNG:
            Erase line across tip-to-body boundary
            Erase and Darken pixels to create marker nib

    To Clipboard:
        On small PNG:
            Erase pixels of clipboard on top and bottom of arrow where it
                crosses the clipboard boundary line.

        Real-life clipboard is 9in x 12.5in, or 18 x 25 or 1:1.39
