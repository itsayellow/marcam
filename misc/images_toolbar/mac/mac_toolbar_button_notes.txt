Screen grabs from retina screen are 2x pixels vs. non-retina bmps

Our buttons
-----------
Mac
    Dimensions: 24px x 24px
    Lines:
        color: 76,76,76 or 0x4c,0x,0x4c
    Procedure:
        1. Create a vector-drawn version
        2. Rasterize to a high resolution
        3. Reduce image to proper button bitmap size
        4. Clean up individual pixels with pencil and eraser in photoshop

Research
--------
Mac buttons:
    regular: monochrome
    activated: blue fg
    bg color: 243, 243, 243
    fg color: 115, 115, 115
    button outline color: 165, 165, 165 ?
    size: ~82w x48h including single pixel outline
      width can be variable (78w seen)
    in wx pixels use 24h x >24w
    rounded corners: pixel radius is 1/4 of height

Mac button (flush, like iTunes play, ffwd, etc.)
    fg 76,76,76
    big: 44px h (actual retina play button top-to-bottom)
    regular: 26 h (actual retina ffwd button)
To Make:
Create a photoshop image 960x960 pixels
Use 243,243,243 as bg
Make a rounded rectangle on top layer
    240 px corner raidus
    2pt, black
Draw inside with color 115,115,115 as "black"
downsize to 24hx?w or hopefully someday 48hx?w for retina @2
