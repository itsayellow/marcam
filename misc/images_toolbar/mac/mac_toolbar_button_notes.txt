Screen grabs from retina screen are 2x pixels vs. non-retina bmps

Our buttons
-----------
Mac
    Dimensions: 24px x 24px
    Lines:
        color: 76,76,76 or 0x4c,0x,0x4c
    Procedure:
        1. Create a vector-drawn version
            A. Vectr: canvas size 640px x 640px
            B. Line width 26px
            C. Fill canvas
        2. Rasterize to a high resolution (choose 300dpi, default size)
        3. Make canvas exactly square (make smaller dimension same size
            as larger dimension)
        3. Reduce image to proper button bitmap size (24 x 24 for Mac)
            A. Bilinear method yields good reduction
        4. Clean up individual pixels with pencil and eraser in photoshop
            A. Make all vertical and horizontal lines full darkness
            B. Erase some fuzz off of vertical and horizontal lines
            C. Artistically clean up other areas (draw/erase)
            D. Always use color (76, 76, 76) but can use transparency for
                lighter colors.

    Zoom to fit:
        30 x 26 w x h overall
         6 x  6 w x h each arrow 
         6 x  6 w x h arrowhead
        18 x 14 w x h rectangle in the middle

Research
--------
Mac buttons:
    regular: monochrome
    activated: blue fg
    bg color: 243, 243, 243
    fg color: 115, 115, 115
    button outline color: 165, 165, 165 ?
    size: ~82w x48h including single pixel outline
      width can be variable (78w seen)
    in wx pixels use 24h x >24w
    rounded corners: pixel radius is 1/4 of height

Mac button (flush, like iTunes play, ffwd, etc.)
    fg 76,76,76
    big: 44px h (actual retina play button top-to-bottom)
    regular: 26 h (actual retina ffwd button)
To Make:
Create a photoshop image 960x960 pixels
Use 243,243,243 as bg
Make a rounded rectangle on top layer
    240 px corner raidus
    2pt, black
Draw inside with color 115,115,115 as "black"
downsize to 24hx?w or hopefully someday 48hx?w for retina @2
