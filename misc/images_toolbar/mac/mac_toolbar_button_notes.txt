Screen grabs from retina screen are 2x pixels vs. non-retina bmps

Our buttons

Mac
    Dimensions: 24px x 24px
    Lines:
        color: 76,76,76 or 0x4c,0x,0x4c

    Procedure:
        1. Create a vector-drawn version (e.g. with LibreOffice Draw, etc.)
            A. Create e.g. a 24in. x 24in sized canvas
            B. Use a grid of 1in., or corresponding to one grid per pixel
                of the final rasterized image
            C. Make sure any horizontal and vertical lines are exactly in
                the grid, i.e. they are in sized and positioned correctly
                i. width of 1in. = 72pt
                ii. centers on (n+0.5)" where n is an integer
            D. Fill canvas as much as possible
            E. Use color 76,76,76 or #4c4c4c
            D. Write out SVG or EPS
                i. EPS: Level 2 color, no tiff preview
        2. Rasterize
            A. use imagemagick to convert to 24px x 24px image with "box"
                filter, which takes average color under pixel area:
                ../../../build_scripts/vec2png 24 *.svg
                    -or-
                convert -colorspace sRGB -background transparent input.{eps,svg}
                        -filter box -resize 24x24 PNG32:output.png
        3. Clean up resulting png if necessary
            A. For pixels partially overlapping original lines, use
                same color but variable transparency, do NOT use lighter color


Specific Bitmap Notes
---------------------
    Zoom to fit:
        Erase corner of square at tail of arrows
        
        Mac preview zoom-to-fit toolbar image:
            30 x 26 w x h overall
             6 x  6 w x h each arrow 
             6 x  6 w x h arrowhead
            18 x 14 w x h rectangle in the middle

    To Clipboard:
        Real-life clipboard is 9in x 12.5in, or 18 x 25

Research
--------
Mac buttons:
    regular: monochrome
    activated: blue fg
    bg color: 243, 243, 243
    fg color: 115, 115, 115
    button outline color: 165, 165, 165 ?
    size: ~82w x48h including single pixel outline
      width can be variable (78w seen)
    in wx pixels use 24h x >24w
    rounded corners: pixel radius is 1/4 of height

Mac button (flush, like iTunes play, ffwd, etc.)
    fg 76,76,76
    big: 44px h (actual retina play button top-to-bottom)
    regular: 26 h (actual retina ffwd button)
To Make:
Create a photoshop image 960x960 pixels
Use 243,243,243 as bg
Make a rounded rectangle on top layer
    240 px corner raidus
    2pt, black
Draw inside with color 115,115,115 as "black"
downsize to 24hx?w or hopefully someday 48hx?w for retina @2
