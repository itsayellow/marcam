Screen grabs from retina screen are 2x pixels vs. non-retina bmps

Our buttons
-----------
Mac
    Dimensions: 24px x 24px
    Lines:
        color: 76,76,76 or 0x4c,0x,0x4c
    Original Procedure:
        1. Create a vector-drawn version
            A. Vectr: canvas size 640px x 640px
            B. Line width 26px (1/24 of canvas edge size, in order
                for lines to be 1px wide in final 24 x 24 bitmap.)
            C. Fill canvas
        2. Rasterize to a high resolution (choose 300dpi, default size)
        3. Make canvas exactly square (make smaller dimension same size
            as larger dimension)
        3. Reduce image to proper button bitmap size (24 x 24 for Mac)
            A. Bilinear method yields good reduction
        4. Clean up individual pixels with pencil and eraser in photoshop
            A. Make all vertical and horizontal lines full darkness
            B. Erase some fuzz off of vertical and horizontal lines
            C. Artistically clean up other areas (draw/erase)
            D. Always use color (76, 76, 76) but can use transparency for
                lighter colors.

    New Procedure:
        1. Create a vector-drawn version (e.g. with LibreOffice Draw, etc.)
            A. Create e.g. a 24in. x 24in sized canvas
            B. Use a grid of 1in., or corresponding to one grid per pixel
                of the final rasterized image
            C. Make sure any horizontal and vertical lines are exactly in
                the grid, i.e. they are in sized and positioned correctly
                i. width of 1in. = 72pt
                ii. centers on (n+0.5)" where n is an integer
            D. Fill canvas as much as possible
            D. Write out EPS, because svg seems to be problemmatic (!)
        2. Rasterize
            A. use imagemagick to convert to 24px x 24px image with "box"
                filter, which takes average color under pixel area:
                convert -colorspace sRGB -background transparent input.eps
                        -filter box -resize 24x24 PNG32:output.png
        3. Clean up resulting png if necessary
    Zoom to fit:
        30 x 26 w x h overall
         6 x  6 w x h each arrow 
         6 x  6 w x h arrowhead
        18 x 14 w x h rectangle in the middle

Research
--------
Mac buttons:
    regular: monochrome
    activated: blue fg
    bg color: 243, 243, 243
    fg color: 115, 115, 115
    button outline color: 165, 165, 165 ?
    size: ~82w x48h including single pixel outline
      width can be variable (78w seen)
    in wx pixels use 24h x >24w
    rounded corners: pixel radius is 1/4 of height

Mac button (flush, like iTunes play, ffwd, etc.)
    fg 76,76,76
    big: 44px h (actual retina play button top-to-bottom)
    regular: 26 h (actual retina ffwd button)
To Make:
Create a photoshop image 960x960 pixels
Use 243,243,243 as bg
Make a rounded rectangle on top layer
    240 px corner raidus
    2pt, black
Draw inside with color 115,115,115 as "black"
downsize to 24hx?w or hopefully someday 48hx?w for retina @2
